Lucene++
==========

Welcome to lucene++ version **3.0.8**.

Lucene++ is a C++ port of the popular Java [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/)
library, a high-performance, full-featured text search engine.


Lucene++ Components
----------------

- liblucene++ library
- liblucene++-contrib library
- lucene++-tester (unit tester)
- deletefiles (demo)
- indexfiles (demo)
- searchfiles (demo)

For information on building the Lucene++ suite, please read doc/BUILDING.md


Useful Resources

To run unit test suite
----------------------

lucene_tester is built using the [Google Testing Framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).
you can run the test suite on unix with the following command run from the
repository root::
```
    $ build/src/test/lucene++-tester
```

the test suite can also be run from the repository root on NT systems, but the required DLL
files must manually be copied into the test binary path before executing, otherwise you will
recieve errors telling you that required libraries cannot be found.
```
    $ build/src/test/lucene++-tester
```

Command options can be discovered by supplying `--help`.


To run the demos
----------------

Start by indexing a directory of files - open a command prompt and run
```
    ./indexfiles <directory to index> <directory to store index>
```
Once the indexer has finished, you can query the index using searchfiles
```
    ./searchfiles -index <directory you stored the index in>
```
This uses an interactive command for you to enter queries, type a query to search the index press enter and you'll see the results.
